This game is a variation of smash karts (https://smashkarts.io/ ). Two-player game that can be played on the same device using a split screen. The goal is to kill each other by throwing/shooting with different pickups that would lower each other’s health index. The pickups are spread out around the track and randomly generated. Once the health index runs out, the player is killed. Each game is a single round that lasts 2 minutes, where if a player is killed within the round, they are regenerated and the player’s health index is refilled. The player with the highest amount of kills wins. Players can also pick up a shield that would make them immune to attacks for a short time period.
